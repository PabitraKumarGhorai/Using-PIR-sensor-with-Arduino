# Using-PIR-sensor-with-Arduino
PIR sensor is a Passive Infrared Sensor which is used for detecting living things.When the sensor is idle, both slots detect the same amount of IR, the ambient amount radiated from the room or walls or outdoors. When a warm body like a human or animal passes by, it first intercepts one half of the PIR sensor, which causes a positive differential change between the two halves. When the warm body leaves the sensing area, the reverse happens, whereby the sensor generates a negative differential change. These change pulses are what is detected. It has three pins VCC,Vout and GND.
